## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was a bit nervous about adding the colored line on top of the cards and wasn’t sure how easy it would be to achieve. Surprisingly, I solved it quickly and easily, which showed me that I’ve definitely improved xD

```css
.card-color {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  height: 4px;
}
```

### Continued development

I will work towards writing more flexible code in the future, incorporating best practices along the way.
